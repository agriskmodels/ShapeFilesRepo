The rectangular survey data are a reference system for land tenure based upon meridian, township/range, section, section subdivision and government lots. The non-rectangular survey data represent surveys that were largely performed to protect and/or convey title on specific parcels of land such as mineral surveys and tracts. The data are largely complete in reference to the rectangular survey data at the level of first division. However, the data varies in terms of granularity of its spatial representation as well as its content below the first division. Therefore, depending upon the data source and steward, accurate subdivision of the rectangular data may not be available below the first division and the non-rectangular minerals surveys may not be present. At times, the complexity of surveys rendered the collection of data cost prohibitive such as in areas characterized by numerous, overlapping mineral surveys. In these situations, the data were often not abstracted or were only partially abstracted and incorporated into the data set. These PLSS data were compiled from a broad spectrum or sources including federal, county, and private survey records such as field notes and plats as well as map sources such as USGS 7 ½ minute quadrangles. The metadata in each data set describes the production methods for the data content. This data is optimized for data publication and sharing rather than for specific "production" or operation and maintenance. A complete PLSS data set includes the following: PLSS Townships, First Divisions and Second Divisions (the hierarchical break down of the PLSS Rectangular surveys) PLSS Special surveys (non-rectangular components of the PLSS) Meandered Water, Corners, Metadata at a Glance (which identified last revised date and data steward) and Conflicted Areas (known areas of gaps or overlaps or inconsistencies). The Entity-Attribute section of this metadata describes these components in greater detail. The PLSS First Division is commonly the section. This is the first set of divisions for a PLSS Township.</abstract><purpose>The purpose of this data is to provide a source of information as a reference for mapping and geographically depicting the rights and interests in real property. These data are intended for use in resource management and planning applications, as well as cartographic display. These data are not intended to replace or be used in lieu of official survey records and therefore, should not be used to process specific land transactions or identify rights and interests in land. To provide the polygons for the first divisions of the PLSS Township.</purpose></descript><timeperd><timeinfo><rngdates><begdate>20080101</begdate><enddate>publication date</enddate></rngdates></timeinfo><current>publication date</current></timeperd><status><progress>Complete</progress><update>As needed</update></status><spdom><bounding><westbc>-90.418136</westbc><eastbc>-82.122971</eastbc><northbc>48.306063</northbc><southbc>41.696118</southbc></bounding></spdom><keywords><theme><themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt><themekey>planningCadastre</themekey></theme><theme><themekt>FGDC Cadastral Content Standard</themekt><themekey>cadastral</themekey></theme><theme><themekt>BLM-Theme</themekt><themekey>Geospatial</themekey></theme><place><placekt>BLM-STATE</placekt><placekey>MI</placekey><placekey>ES</placekey><placekey>Eastern States</placekey><placekey>Michigan</placekey></place></keywords><accconst>As authorized by contract; no constraints.</accconst><useconst>These data are provided by Bureau of Land Management (BLM) “as is” and might contain errors or omissions.
